Time taken: 5.5hrs

## Task 1



I recreated the bitmap image with css except for the love hearts. Found vector graphic, but wasnt sure how to create element with css.
element is '<i class="fas fa-heart"></i> ' with awsome fonts.
sorry about different size

## Task 2

Layout is now responsive.

## Task 3

Used JQuery to grab JSON data. Feeds into the 'json01' element.
The second JSON file is used as a search mechanism.
3rd JSON as puzzling. It took ages to load into webpage and crashed computer. I tried to post and ID to the query and still took ages.
alternative solution was to use Angular but wasnt sure if this would take longer or not.
